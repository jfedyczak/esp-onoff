 StellarisDS18B20.h - Yes I know it's a long name.

This library works with both 430 and Stellaris using the Energia IDE.

 Not sure who the original author is, as I've seen the core code used in a few different One Wire lib's.
 Am sure it came from Arduino folks.
 There are no processor hardware dependant calls.
 Had troubles with delayMicrosecond() exiting early when the library used by Stellaris.
 So replaced them with a micros() while loop. The timing loop was tuned to suit the Stellaris
 It was disconcerting that a difference of 1 micro second would make the routines intermittingly fail.
 Anyway after nearly two weeks think I have solved all the delay problems.

 History:
 29/Jan/13 - Finished porting MSP430 to Stellaris
